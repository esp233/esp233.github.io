My current work covers the following areas: the implementation and application of automated systems such as **AI and blockchains in subaltern contexts** across the Asia Pacific, **grassroot efforts** for online participation and the remaking of intersectionality in the digital era, the **political-economic structures** that condition actions from the margins, and the **global influence of China-based digital ecosystems**.

I presented some preliminary outcomes of these ongoing projects at international conferences and workshops, but there is much more to come!
