Hi, friends! My name is Jiaxi Hou. I am an interdisciplinary ethnographer exploring the interplay between marginality and digital technologies, with a particular focus on social class.

My affiliation and educational background
------
Meanwhile, I am an incoming Research Fellow at the RMIT node of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making & Society. My work contributes to one of the Centre's [signature project](https://www.admscentre.org.au/language-and-cultural-diversity-in-adm-australia-in-the-asia-pacific/), which explores how automated decision-making systems and cultural and linguistic diversity are mutually reshaping each other across the Asia Pacific region. 

I earned my PhD in Interdisciplinary Information Studies from the University of Tokyo in 2024, where I also completed my master's degree. Prior to that, I received a B.A. in Journalism and Communication from Tsinghua University. Click [here](../assets/cv202410.pdf) for my academic CV.

My research
------
**How do digital technologies intertwine with the subaltern pursuits of living a better life within today's increasingly unequal world?** This central question guides my research. 

My doctoral project is a deep dive into this inquiry. It focuses on the digital reconfiguration of poverty, inequality, and marginality in contemporary China by revisiting and critiquing Marxist concept of class. Titiled *Reassambling Class in Digital China: Inequality, Technology, and Agency from Below*, this work is an ethnographic exploration of how Chinese disadvantaged populations—including but not limited to peasants and migrants—excercise agency in their pursuit of social mobility and alternative ways of living through active engagement with mobile devices and digital platforms. 

While digital inclusion may seem empowering, my dissertation shows how this process often contributes to an engulfing post-socialist, post-industrial, and technology-mediated structure that further exploits and marginalizes the underprivileged groups. I refer to this phenomenon as the emergence of the *digital lumpen proletariat*, a class-based neoliberal subjectivity. 

I also have a passion for exploring Internet-based musical practices, digital gaming cultures, and the socio-cultural histories of Asian societies. The voices of those overlooked or even humiliated are my ultimate source of inspiration.  

Beyond academia
------
I once worked as a news editor at [SOHU.com](https://www.sohu.com), a Chinese news portal, and an independent documentary producer. My co-produced documentary project *2306* tells the stories of precarious migrant workers in Beijing. It has been screened in a dozens cities in China, Japan, and Italy. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWsc6KKmsks) for a trailer of the work.

In my everyday life, I enjoy Chinese rock music and Hong Kong ganster films. Playing *Stardew Valley*, the farming simulation game, and navigating *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* always bring me peace.  

I am a non-Han Chinese, a first-generation university graduate and academic, and a mom. I grew up in an immigrant family, where my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all new comers to their long-term place of residency. The multiple roots of my family are deeply intertwined with my own ever-changing journey.
