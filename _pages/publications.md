My research unpacks the remaking of social class, particularly the underclass in contemporary China, from the following four dimensions: **precarious labor**, **cultural creation**, **consumption**, and **financialization**. 

## Gig Work, Informal Labor, and Digital Gaming

### Playing to Earn: An Overview of Chinese Informal Gamer-Workers
**Hou, J.**, & Liu, X. in *Global Media and China*, under review.

**Abstract**: China has emerged as a superpower in the realm of digital gaming. The prosperity of China’s digital gaming ecosystem would be unattainable without the contributions of large armies of informal gamer-workers, many of whom coming from underprivileged backgrounds. Gamer-workers are individuals whose gaming experiences are deeply intertwined with the career aspirations and earning a livelihood. While previous analyses have examined separate roles, such as gold farmers, play companions, and live streamers, these have yet to be unified into a “big picture” of informal play-to-earn practices. This paper presents an overview that highlights the intrinsic connections among the multiple types of gamer-workers and explores the social perceptions and functions of their digital game labor. 
 
## Cultural Creation, Class Conflicts, and Grassroot Entrepreneurship

### Vulgarizing a Subaltern Taste on Chinese Social Media: The Rise and Fall of *Hanmai* Rap and Social Shake Dance
**Hou, J.** in *Internet Vulgarities in China: Cultures, Governance and Politics*, forthcoming. 

**Abstract**: This chapter explores the rise, fall, and resurgence of *hanmai* 喊麦 rap and social shake dance 社会摇 on Kuaishou, a TikTok like mobile app popular among the Chinese underclass. The two interconnected genres are often viewed as crude expressions devoid of aesthetic value, or as a form of grassroots resistance in the Chinese public sphere. However, moving beyond these interpretations, this chapter highlights how the public portrayal of the two Internet sensations as vulgar embodies a socio-cultural mechanism of marginalization in China today. Vulgarity intertwines with subalternity and is deeply influenced by platform architectures, state interventions, and the gaze of middle-class audiences.   

### "Selling Poverty" on Kuaishou: How Entrepreneurialism Disciplines Chinese Underclass Online Participation
**Hou, J.**, & Zhang, Y. in *Global Media and China*, 7(3), 263-82, 2022.

**Abstract**: The meanings of underclass in China are increasingly ambivalent when various disadvantaged social groups become new internet users. This study examines how a number of underprivileged communities like peasants, ethnic minorities, and migrants represent poverty and themselves by creating short videos and performing live-commerce on Kuaishou. It highlights that platform-based entrepreneurialism has become an interlocking governmentality to discipline the underclass' online participation.

### A Platform for Underclass Youth: Hanmai Rap Videos, Social Class, and Surveillance on Chinese Social Media
**Hou, J.** in *First Monday*, 26(9), 2021.

**Abstract**: This essay investigates what role social media have played in the emergence of an underclass habitus among Chinese youth. By focusing on the rise and fall of a participatory *hanmai* 喊麦 rap culture on Kuaishou, it illustrates how social media platforms effectively mediate, regulate, and buttress class conflicts and social differentiation in China by constantly reshaping their algorithmic structures, monetization strategies, and governing policies.

### Contesting the Vulgar *Hanmai* 喊麦 Performance from Kuaishou: Online Vigilantism toward Chinese Underclass Youths on Social Media Platforms
**Hou, J.** in *Introducing Vigilant Audiences*, pp.49-75, 2020.

**Abstract**: This study traces various vigilant practices targeting *hanmai* 喊麦 creators and fans in Chinese digital landscape. While *hanmai* rap culture paves the way for an emerging collective identity among diverse underclass groups, its technologically mediated visibility also reinforces class struggles. Particularly, middle-class audiences of *hanmai* use aethetic, moral, and technological concerns as a weapon to denounce the vulgarities of Chinese underclass and demonstrate their own superiority.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
