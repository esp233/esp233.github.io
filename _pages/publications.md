My research unpacks the remaking of social class, particularly the underclass in contemporary China, from the following four dimensions: **precarious labor**, **cultural creation**, **consumption**, and **financialization**. 

I also regularly write reviews for books on **critical internet studies**, **platform economy**, and **cultural studies** that concentrate on the global experiences of marginalized communities.

## Gig Work, Informal Labor, and Digital Gaming

### Playing to Earn: An Overview of Chinese Informal Gamer-Workers
**Hou, J.**, & Liu, X. in *Global Media and China*, under review.

**Abstract**: China has emerged as a superpower in the realm of digital gaming. The prosperity of China’s digital gaming ecosystem would be unattainable without the contributions of large armies of informal gamer-workers, many of whom coming from underprivileged backgrounds. Gamer-workers are individuals whose gaming experiences are deeply intertwined with the career aspirations and earning a livelihood. While previous analyses have examined separate roles, such as gold farmers, play companions, and live streamers, these have yet to be unified into a “big picture” of informal play-to-earn practices. This paper presents an overview that highlights the intrinsic connections among the multiple types of gamer-workers and explores the social perceptions and functions of their digital game labor. 
 
## Cultural Creation, Class Conflicts, and Grassroot Entrepreneurship

### Vulgarizing a Subaltern Taste on Chinese Social Media: The Rise and Fall of *Hanmai* Rap and Social Shake Dance
**Hou, J.** in *Internet Vulgarities in China: Cultures, Governance and Politics*, forthcoming. 

**Abstract**: This chapter explores the rise, fall, and resurgence of *hanmai* 喊麦 rap and social shake dance 社会摇 on Kuaishou, a TikTok like mobile app popular among the Chinese underclass. The two interconnected genres are often viewed as crude expressions devoid of aesthetic value, or as a form of grassroots resistance in the Chinese public sphere. However, moving beyond these interpretations, this chapter highlights how the public portrayal of the two Internet sensations as vulgar embodies a socio-cultural mechanism of marginalization in China today. Vulgarity intertwines with subalternity and is deeply influenced by platform architectures, state interventions, and the gaze of middle-class audiences.   

### "Selling Poverty" on Kuaishou: How Entrepreneurialism Disciplines Chinese Underclass Online Participation
**Hou, J.**, & Zhang, Y. in *Global Media and China*, 7(3), 263-82, 2022.

**Abstract**: The meanings of underclass in China are increasingly ambivalent when various disadvantaged social groups become new internet users. This study examines how a number of underprivileged communities like peasants, ethnic minorities, and migrants represent poverty and themselves by creating short videos and performing live-commerce on Kuaishou. It highlights that platform-based entrepreneurialism has become an interlocking governmentality to discipline the underclass' online participation.

### A Platform for Underclass Youth: *Hanmai* Rap Videos, Social Class, and Surveillance on Chinese Social Media
**Hou, J.** in *First Monday*, 26(9), 2021.

**Abstract**: This essay investigates what role social media have played in the emergence of an underclass habitus among Chinese youth. By focusing on the rise and fall of a participatory *hanmai* 喊麦 rap culture on Kuaishou, it illustrates how social media platforms effectively mediate, regulate, and buttress class conflicts and social differentiation in China by constantly reshaping their algorithmic structures, monetization strategies, and governing policies.

### Contesting the Vulgar *Hanmai* Performance from Kuaishou: Online Vigilantism toward Chinese Underclass Youths on Social Media Platforms
**Hou, J.** in *Introducing Vigilant Audiences*, pp.49-75, 2020.

**Abstract**: This study traces various vigilant practices targeting *hanmai* 喊麦 creators and fans in Chinese digital landscape. While *hanmai* rap culture paves the way for an emerging collective identity among diverse underclass groups, its technologically mediated visibility also reinforces class struggles. Particularly, middle-class audiences of *hanmai* use aethetic, moral, and technological concerns as a weapon to denounce the vulgarities of Chinese underclass and demonstrate their own superiority.

## Fan Communities, Data Activism, and Consumption

### Short Video Activism with and on Douyin: An Innovative Repertoire of Contention for Chinese Consumers
Yu, Z., **Hou, J.**, & Zhou, T. in *Social Media + Society*, 9(1), 2023. 

**Abstract**: This article examines consumer video activism tactics in China and their impact on Chinese consumers and society. It argues that short-video-activism tactics have become an innovative repertoire of contention for Chinese consumers and Douyin, the "sister app" of TikTok, has become a real-time updated database of this repertoire. Specifically, Douyin plays three key roles in mediating Chinese consumer activism: a techno-cultural construct that affords highly heterogeneous users to present everyday experiences via short videos; a multisided market that profoundly affects the tactics consumers choose to amplify their voices; and a governing entity that both moderates content for its users and simultaneously is subject to government regulations.

### To Exaggerate Data at All Costs: Data-Driven Fan Culture, Platforms, and the Remaking of the New Poor in China
**Hou, J.** in *Asiascape: Digital Asia* 9(3), 273-301, 2022.

**Abstract**: Among Chinese fans of "traffic celebrities" 流量明星, generating excessive data either on digital platforms or various sales charts to inflate a specific entertainer’s popularity has become a normalized ritual to demonstrate their fan identity. The so-called fandom economy effectively mobilizes fans from diverse socio-economic backgrounds to consume and participate, thus generating tremendous revenue. Although some fans can easily satisfy their consumerist desire for being economically powerful and socially successful, many others who are seduced by the communitas of fan activism and agency as consumers cannot or are not yet fully able to afford this lifestyle. This study unpacks how these fans are seduced and, to some extent, included but still exploited in the transitional Chinese consumer society as what Bauman calls the "new poor", for whom digital platforms have become a new structuring nexus and transform the existing power dynamics.

## Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies, and Financialization

### Making Ends Meet by Mining on Blockchain: Subalternity, Materiality, and Yearnings of Chinese Amateur Crypto Miners
**Hou, J.** in *Journal of Digital Social Research*, 5(2), 80-117, 2023.

**Abstract**: While public narratives indicate that blockchain is widely used in developed societies among privileged elites, either from socio-economic, ethnic, or techno-cultural perspectives, this study examines how some disadvantaged marginal others, specifically the subaltern *shehuiren* 社会人 in China, survive in the increasingly precarious post-socialist Chinese society by engaging with blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Literally translated as “society people”, *shehuiren* are the socio-economically and techno-culturally disadvantaged others who face marginality due to various post-socialist institutional inequalities. This study unpacks how, on the one hand, the blockchain scene has been reconfigured by the disadvantaged in the local context, and on the other hand, how subalternity is actualized in post-socialist China, where blockchain-related technologies deeply intertwine with various forms of social inequalities.
